MAKE A WIC APPOINTMENT

Before you can add your baby to
WIC, you will have to make an appointment. They may do this in person or over the phone. To make a WIC appointment, call (919)250-4720. If they do not answer, go on the website: https://services.wake.gov/WICSignup/Index.html
You can put "call with a interpreter" in any of the blanks. Once you get WIC benefits, you can go on the EBT Edge App to see which benefits you have.


WHO IS ELIGIBLE FOR WIC?

If you receive Food Stamps or have Medicaid, you are automatically eligible. If you do not, you can Google
"WIC Eligibility" and see if your income meets the requirements.


NEED BABY ITEMS?

Check with your Medicaid first and see if they can supply any baby items. If you need baby items, Refugee Hope Partners can help you get them. We partner with local agencies that have baby items and diapers for free. If you need something, text Jenna at 984-263-0869
