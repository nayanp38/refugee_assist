Refugee Hope Partners does not help with applying for other health insurance, but a group called NC Legal Aid does. They will be able to get an interpreter for you, walk you through the application, and help you choose a health plan. Make an appointment by visiting this website:

**How often do I need to recertify?**

You may be required to update your information either every 6 or 12 months. If you fail to respond or send the papers back in, you may lose your coverage.


**What will my card look like?**

Medicaid uses other insurance providers, such as Healthy Blue, Carolina Complete, Well Care, NC Medicaid Direct, or others. All the cards look different, and they may not say Medicaid on them.


**What do I do if I lose my card?**

You can call the member services number for your provider (Well Care, Healthy Blue, Carolina Complete, or others). Sometimes you can do this online if you make an account with your provider.
